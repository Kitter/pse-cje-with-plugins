#CloudBees Private SaaS Edition Managed Master Template Example
This repository provides an example of how you may create custom Docker images to use for managed masters connected to a CloudBees Jenkions Operations Center running on the CloudBees Private SaaS Edition.

Besides the `Dockerfile`, it consists of two primary customization components:
- additional/upgraded plugins
- initilization scirpts (Groovy init scripts)
